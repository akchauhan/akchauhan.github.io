           <strong> <p> "How that spirit wandering,</p>
                       <p>   Everyforenoon showing gestureness,</p><br/>
                    <p> Pranced towards the arriving,</p>
                       <p>   Nothing there but felt a familiarness,</p>
                    <p> Perhaps come through whipping,</p>
                       <p>   Made my heart pounding.</p><br/>
                    <p> Chasing it with chivalric certainty,</p>
                       <p>   Surrounding made me to feel solitary,</p>
                    <p> No creatures,No sign of life,No commotion at all there,</p>
                       <p>   I felt myself in too much glomyness,</p>
                    <p> Abruptly a sweet angel appeared with amber glow face,</p>
                       <p>   Made me to feel my heart blitheness.</p><br/>
                    <p> Still unaware of that spirit,</p>
                       <p>   I hesitated a bit,</p>
                    <p> But her cuteness moved me for apart,</p>
                       <p>   Leaving no questions in my heart.</p><br/>
				    <p> Gazed at her face prolonged,</p>
                       <p>   Totally oblivious to the world around,</p>
				    <p> It was nothing around except us,</p> 
                       <p>   Under the same sky and on the same sites.</p><br/>	
                    <p> By the by soulmate departed from my sight,</p>
                       <p>   Showed me a gesture of love alright,</p>
                    <p> At the eleventh hour, I said,</p>
                       <p>   A beauty whose beautiness reflects from her sanctity."</p></strong><br/>
